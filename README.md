# grabfiles

Small utility to download links with specified file extenstion from a url.

Example:
$ grabfiles url [optional extenstions]

Default extenstions are ".c" ".h" ".pdf"

Lots of this was "borrowed" from https://schier.co/blog/2015/04/26/a-simple-web-scraper-in-go.html
and from https://golangcode.com/download-a-file-from-a-url/
